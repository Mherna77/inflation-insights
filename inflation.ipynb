    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation plays a significant role in financial stability and the purchasing power of consumers, influencing everything from daily expenses to long-term economic planning. As inflation fluctuates across global economies, understanding how economic indicators affect inflation is crucial for evaluating economic health. The main problem we want to address is determining how inflation impacts consumer purchasing power and identifying which economic factors influence inflation the most across various countries. To investigate this, we plan to analyze global inflation trends and examine how they relate to key financial indicators. We will do this by using regression and clustering models/techniques to find patterns on how inflation affects consumer purchasing power and identify which economic environments are more vulnerable to inflationary pressure.\n"

    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will use in this project comes from an existing Kaggle dataset called \"Global Economic Indicators (2010–2025)- World bank\" by Tanishk Sharma. This dataset has 16 key features including: Country Name, Country Id, Year, Inflation (Consumer Price Index %), GDP (Current USD), GDP per Capita, GDP Growth (% Annual), Unemployment Rate, Real Interest Rate, Public Debt (% of GDP), Government Expense and Revenue, Current Account Balance, Gross National Income, and Tax Revenue. These features provide a comprehensive view of the economic landscape across various countries, which makes this dataset well-suited for our problem."
